# Pricing Optimization: Maximizing Profit with Data-Driven Insights

This project demonstrates the use of data-driven techniques to optimize pricing strategies and maximize profit. By leveraging a real-world dataset from a superstore, this program simulates pricing scenarios to identify the price point that yields the highest profit, offering valuable insights into consumer behavior and profitability.

## Methodology
1. Data Exploration:
    * Conducted an initial analysis of the dataset to understand key variables such as sales, price, shipping cost, and discounts.
    * Displayed dataset structure and statistics, providing insights into the data distribution and its overall consistency
      ##    Dataset Info:
    * - Total Entries: 51,209
    * - Columns: Category, City, State, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Shipping.Cost, Price, Order.Date, Ship.Date
     
   
    * - Summary Statistics:
    *   Mean Price: 26.38
    *   Mean Quantity: 4.48
    *   Mean Discount: 0.14
      
2. Model Development:
    * Built a machine learning model to estimate profit based on price and other features.
    * Trained and tested the model on historical data to ensure accuracy.
3. Optimization:
    * Conducted simulations to identify the optimal pricing point that maximizes profit.
    * Visualized the relationship between price and profit through a profit curve.
4. Visualization:
    * Plotted results, including the profit curve and the optimal pricing point, to provide actionable insights.
    * Explored correlations between price and quantity sold to highlight consumer behavior trends.
## Results
Using the provided dataset, the program identified an optimal price of $50, which yielded the maximum profit of $35.00.
